# SpotifyAutomationSuite

Welcome to SpotifyAutomationSuite - a Java-based test automation framework designed to facilitate web and API testing for the Spotify web application. This framework incorporates Selenium WebDriver for robust browser interaction, Cucumber for behavior-driven development (BDD), and REST Assured for API testing to ensure the Spotify application runs smoothly across different web environments.

## Features

- **Automated Web Testing**: Leverages Selenium WebDriver to simulate user interactions with the Spotify web application.
- **Behavior-Driven Development**: Utilizes Cucumber to write tests in a way that can be understood by anyone familiar with the domain, ensuring tests are readable and maintainable.
- **API Testing**: Incorporates REST Assured to test Spotify's RESTful APIs with ease.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Configured to support multiple browsers, aiding in comprehensive test coverage.
- **Continuous Integration Compatibility**: Ready for integration with CI/CD pipelines like Jenkins, CircleCI, etc., for automated test execution and deployment.
- **Secure Testing**: Uses a credentials file ignored by Git to maintain security while testing with real accounts.
